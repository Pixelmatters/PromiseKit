![PromiseKit](http://promisekit.org/public/img/logo-500.png)

Modern development is highly asynchronous: isn‚Äôt it about time we had tools that made programming asynchronously powerful, easy and delightful?

```swift
firstly {
    UIApplication.shared().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = true
}.then {
    when(fetchImage(), getLocation())
}.then { image, location in
    self.imageView.image = image;
    self.label.text = "Buy your cat a house in \(location)"
}.always {
    UIApplication.shared().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = false
}.catch { error in
    UIAlertView(/*‚Ä¶*/).show()
}
```

PromiseKit is a thoughtful and complete implementation of promises for iOS and macOS with first-class support for **both** Objective-C *and* Swift.

# Getting Setup

```ruby
#CocoaPods
pod "PromiseKit", "~> 4.0"

#Carthage
github "mxcl/PromiseKit" ~> 4.0
```

Or, clone the project and drag and drop its `xcodeproj` into your Xcode project.

# Learning The Ropes

* Check out our complete, comprehensive [PromiseKit documentation](http://promisekit.org/docs/).

Neither CocoaPods or Carthage will install PromiseKit 2, 3 or 4 for an iOS 7 target. You need PromiseKit 1.7:

    pod "PromiseKit", "~> 1.7"

PromiseKit 1.7 has only limited Swift support.

# PromiseKit vs. Xcode

PromiseKit contains Swift, so we engage in an unending battle with Xcode:
>>>>>>> Compiles with Xcode 8 beta3

* Xcode 8 = PromiseKit 4
* Xcode 7 = PromiseKit 3
* Xcode 6 = PromiseKit 2

PromiseKit 1 is pure Objective-C and we still maintain it.

# Support

PromiseKit is lucky enough to have a large community behind it which is reflected in our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/mxcl/PromiseKit). If you're new to PromiseKit and are stumped or otherwise have a question that doesn't feel like an issue (and isn't answered in our [documentation](http://promisekit.org/introduction)) then our Gitter is a great place to go for help. Of course if you're onto something that you believe is broken or could be improved then opening a new issue is still the way to go üëç.

# Donations

PromiseKit is hundreds of hours of work almost completely by just me: [Max Howell](https://twitter.com/mxcl). I thoroughly enjoyed making PromiseKit, but nevertheless if you have found it useful then your bitcoin will give me a warm fuzzy feeling from my head right down to my toes: 1JDbV5zuym3jFw4kBCc5Z758maUD8e4dKR.
